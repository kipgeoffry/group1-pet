### About this project 
A Web Application to demonstrate skills learnt in Week 4 of the study, as part of **Moringa School Group1** Peer project.   
This is a Web Application about a Pet developed in [NodeJS][1], [Express][2], [NPM][3] and [EJS][4].  
The main task is developing routes (middlewares) with the help of Express  and Embended JavaScript to enable the webservice
